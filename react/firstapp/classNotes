React
==> it is a JS Library not a framework like Angular
it creates SPA(Single page Application)

MVC ==>
Model
View : React
Controller

Why to use react?
use of component based structure

Properties of React
Data driven
Uni-directional way(data flows in just one direction)

node will be the one which will provide run time for the react Application

in react we create JSX
JavaScript and XML

In React you don't have the acces to the Real DOM
you have the access to the Virtual DOM
react provides this virtual DOM which connects and talk to the Real DOM


React we have the concept of State.
In React, you have a single source of truth.(data).
unidirectional.


current State vs upcoming State

Virtual DOM vs real DOM
Only the required changes are then pushed to the real DOM.

Types of components:
1. Class based components
2. functional components

1. class based components are used when you want to manipulate the state. (you want to update the state.)
2. functional components we are just using the state not manipulating it.
In functional one can access the state data via props.




<=== Constructor ===>>
var object = {}
var object = new Object {}
var object = {
    name: 'akkas',
    sex : 'Male'
}
Constructor is part of the class
